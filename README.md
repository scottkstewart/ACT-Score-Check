#ACT-Score-Check
This is a personal redundant utility to email any changes to the ACT's website concerning score. Ignore the messy code, I wrote this in basically no time because I was bored, wanted to brush up my web parsing (as with Subreddit-Background), and the ACT was taking forever to release my score.
